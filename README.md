This is an C++ port of my existing OpenGL Rust learning project.  


__Me__  
Why am I now recreating my Rust project in C++? Can you explain that?

__ChatGPT__  
Without knowing the specific details of your project or situation, I can offer some general 
reasons why someone might switch or reimplement a project from Rust to C++. Each technology 
has its strengths, weaknesses, and suitable use cases, and switching from one language to 
another can be motivated by various factors. Here are some possible considerations:

* __Developer Availability__  
  C++ has a longer history and a broader base of developers. If your team or organization 
  has more experience with C++ than with Rust, this could be a reason for the switch
  to accelerate or simplify development.<br/><br/>
* __Existing Codebase and Integration__  
  If your project or parts of it need to be integrated into an existing C++ codebase, or 
  if you want to use libraries or frameworks available in C++, which are not easily accessible
  from Rust, this could also be a reason.<br/><br/> 
* __Performance and Control__   
  Although Rust offers excellent performance characteristics and very good control over system 
  resources, there are certain scenarios, especially in very specialized areas of systems 
  programming or when using certain platform-specific features, where C++ might be better or 
  easier to use.<br/><br/>
* __Industry Standards and Compatibility__  
  In some industries, C++ standards and practices are deeply ingrained, such as in game 
  development, embedded systems, or high-frequency trading technology. Using C++ in such 
  areas may be influenced by existing tools, codebases, and practices.<br/><br/>
* __Specific Libraries and Frameworks__  
  Sometimes the decision for a programming language depends on specific libraries or 
  frameworks that are better supported in one language. C++ has a vast collection of libraries 
  and tools that have been developed over decades, and in some cases, it offers access to more 
  advanced or specialized tools that are not available or not yet available in Rust.<br/><br/>
* __Personal or Organizational Preference__  
  Sometimes subjective reasons like the team's personal preference or an 
  organization's strategic direction can play a role.<br/></br>
* __Learning Purposes__  
  Perhaps you or your team also simply want to deepen skills in another technology and choose 
  an existing project as a learning tool.

If none of these reasons apply or if you have specific questions about the pros and cons, 
it might be useful to reconsider this decision or analyze it more closely to ensure that the 
switch is the best choice for your project's goals.
